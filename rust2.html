<p><font color="white"><small><small>Weapons are key to survival as they provide you with basic offensive and defensive capabilities.
 You may find weapons in Airdrops and Attack Helicopters, 
 and can also craft them after gathering all the required resources for each weapon. 
 you can also buy or find weapons in different POI's within the map.
weapon choice is very important as if you were to use a sniper in a shotgun fight you wouldn't have a chance.  
 Some weapons favor up-close action, whereas others may perform better at a distance. 
 Projectile weapons differ from each other with factors such as accuracy, range, rate of fire and damage.</font></P>

<font color="red"><h1 align="center"> Ammo </font> </h1>

<p> <font color="white">There is different types of ammo in rust, you get different sizes and styles of bullets for different weapons,
you get shotgun gauge's, 5.56 rifle ammo, pistol ammo, rockets and arrows.
 Within each ammo category there are different forms of the ammo all used for different scenarios,
 you can get incendiary bullets, high velocity bullets, explosive bullets and normal bullets.
explosive is the best for raids 
but it can wear down gun durability fast! </font></P>
