<font color="white"><small><small>you can raid other peoples bases. you need to be careful of turrets and be sure to bring plenty of explosives. <br>
it is a good idea to raid the base when the player is off line as if they are in their base you will 
be fighting them on their own turf. you can place ladders to climb over there walls but you 
will need explosives to blast in!</font>
