<p><font color="white"> <small> <small>Rust is a multi-player only survival video game developed and published by Facepunch Studios in 2018.
in the game you gather materials with many different tools to create a base 
where you can create weapons and Armour to raid other bases and be the ultimate clan.
The game is very difficult as there is always other players trying to raid your base so 
you need to defend your stuff with traps like turrets.
What tips the game above the rest is the fact that you can talk too all players in the server.
this makes very funny moments and chances to make new friends.</font></p>
