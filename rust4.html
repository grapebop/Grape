<p> <font color="white"><small><small>to build a base you need a building plan to place structures and a hammer to upgrade them to stronger materials.
you can build out of thatch wood stone sheet metal and high quality metal.
you should build your base small so it costs less to upkeep.
you can build turrets to defend your base too. 
good bases will be as compact as possible while still protecting it with many walls. 
it is a good idea to put your base in hidden location like in a cave.</font>
